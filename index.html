			Hello everyone. My name is Jumi Bitana and I am a <i>We Bare Bears</i> enthusiast. If you have no idea what this is, We Bare Bears is a show on Cartoon Network about 3 adoptive bear brothers: Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear. Situated in the San Francisco Bay Area, the show consists of their awkward attempts to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions or trying to become famous on the Internet. Although these attempts see the bears struggle to do so due to the civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts. However, in the end, they figure out that they have each other for support.

		<br> Here are the following reasons on why I love them very much:
		<ol type="1">
			<li> They teach us morals on brotherhood. </li>
			<li> They do this thing called a <strong>"Bear Stack"</strong> and it is their form of transportation. </li>
			<li> It's really cute that they are always there for each other. </li>
			<li> They're really funny. </li>
			<li> HAVE I MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE SO ADORABLE??? </li>
			<li> Ice Bear makes me smile. </li>
			<li> Grizz, Panpan, and Ice Bear bring so much happiness into my life. </li>
